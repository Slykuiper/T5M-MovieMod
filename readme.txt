for the normal menu (mitch's menu)
while ingame jump + press your use key (look in your controls > interact menu)
controls are in the top right of your screen
to spawn bots while the option is on, press your use key + ads
---
for my menu, press ESC and go to the bottom of the menus on the left side
click on Sly's Movie Menu

with this being version 1, the depth of field sliders menu is incomplete, i'm too uninsterested to finish or update it. DOF should be set with a movie config in theatre mode regardless.
the bo3 menu changes the fog color, so make sure you have fog turned on in the fog menu with the start and end distances set properly.
